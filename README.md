# Compare-Searches
***
## Objective
Compare search times between an array and a Binary tree.

the array will be searched using the following algorithms:
* Sequential
* Exponential

Numbers from 1 to 10000 will be inserted into randomly to the array, the array will have a size of 100,000.

Numbers from 1 to 10000 will be inserted into the Binary tree, the program will automatically sort them and 100,000 values will be inserted.
